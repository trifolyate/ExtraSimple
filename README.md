# ExtraSimple
First running app-ish

ExtraSimple©
- Its an app for a concept restaurant, Extra Simple, that sells simple looking food but flavours so robust and interesting that Gordon Ramsey rated it 5 stars when he came to try the food himself ( as seen from HomeScreenPage)

-  Has a nice welcome screen (need to turn on animations in phone settings)

-  The only feature right now is to book a table, which has the input fields that ask for user’s personal info (name and phone number), and other important information( number of pax, which date, which time, whether their table should be near or away from the smoking area).

- The phone number input field only excepts numbers starting with 9 or 8(Singapore number), and only enables the user to input 8 numbers.

- The No of Pax input field only enables the user to input 2 numbers( cant book a table with more than 99 people)

-  Made it foolproof by urging the user to fill up ALL the fields before confirming the reservation ( 
TOAST text will appear if one or more input fields are empty)

- Once all the important fields are placed, their will be prompted to another screen that shows all of the information, and that the reservation is complete.

- Added a button to prompt the user to go back to the home page, and another button to go back to the book a table page if they want to change anything.

- Future implementation; Learn how to do a maximum date for datepicker, do a min time and maximum time for timepicker.
